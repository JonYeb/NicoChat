# NicoChat
Inspired by NicoDouga, this is a custom widget for StreamElements to have chat messages scroll across the screen

## Installation
* Create a custom widget in your Streamelements overlay
* open editor under settings
* remove existing code - then
  * copy & paste the code in the appropriate blocks
  
## Testing
As there is some special syntax in the widgets you can't run it as is in the browser.  
Files are copied and modified in the `test`-folder, which can be run in your browser to test effects etc.  
Run the command `sendText` in your console to have text scrolling acros your screen
